Concepts
--------

[ ] Object: Any data with state (attributes or value) and defined behavior
    (methods). Also the ultimate base class of any new-style class.
[ ] f-string: String literals prefixed with 'f' or 'F' are commonly called
    "f-strings" which is short for formatted string literals.
[ ] annotations
[ ] slices
[ ] loops: break, continue, else
[ ] default values
[ ] call using keyword arguments
[ ] shebang: the first line of a script starting with `#!` followed by the
    *interperter directive*: the path to the interpreter to use for the script
    #!/usr/bin/env python

[ ] Path
[ ] Strongly typed languages: Require explicitly declaring variable types, use
    static typing to verify type safety usually at compile time.
[ ] Loosely (weakly) typed languages: Types are checked at runtime and may be implicitly converted
[ ] Duck-typing: A system that determines if an object is valid for based on its
    behaviors and properties rather than its type. "If it walks like a duck and it
    quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"



[ ] evaluate
[ ] execute
[ ] scope
[ ] encapsulation
[ ] Object-oriented programming (OOP): An approach to programming that
    organizes code into user-defined types called classes which produce values
    called objects. An object contains behavior (methods) and data (attributes) so
    that it knows how to operate on itself.
