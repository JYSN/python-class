Python Help
-----------

The Python shell has a `help()` function that will give you information on functions, modules and more.

Try some of these in your Python shell:

```python
>>> help(print)
>>> help(def)
>>> help(if)
```

To get help for functions in a module, you must import it first.

```python
>>> import random
>>> help(random.randint)
Help on method randint in module random:

randint(a, b) method of random.Random instance
  Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.
```
